Structural Damage Detection and Classification in Concrete Structures and Bridges Using SSD
Overview
This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), to detect and classify structural damage in concrete structures and bridges. Structural health monitoring is critical in ensuring infrastructure safety, especially in the face of climate change and increasing load demands. By using a deep learning-based approach, this project aims to automate damage detection, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of infrastructure inspections.
